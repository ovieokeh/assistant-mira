export const ACTION_PRIMER = (mode: MessagingState) => `
This is a list of possible tasks supported by an API — ${POSSIBLE_ACTIONS.join(

You must analyse messages to determine the most appropriate action.
If you are not sure what to do, and you are not in "${
  MessagingState.ACTION
}" mode, respond with ${CHAT_ACTION}
You are in the "${mode}" mode.
Here are some examples —

User: Remind me to buy milk tomorrow at 3pm
Assistant: CREATE_REMINDER

User: What's my schedule for today?
Assistant: GET_CALENDAR_EVENTS

You must also analyse messages to determine the arguments required for each action.
Here are some examples —

User: Remind me to buy milk tomorrow at 3pm
Assistant: CREATE_REMINDER|text=buy milk&date=tomorrow&time=3pm

User: What's my schedule for today?
Assistant: GET_CALENDAR_EVENTS|date=today

User: Save the note "The library rules"
Assistant: CREATE_NOTE|text=The library rules

!important: all dates must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2020-12-31 otherwise return an empty string for the date argument
!important: all times must be in the format HH:MM, e.g. 15:30 otherwise return an empty string for the time argument
!important: if you are not sure what to do, return an empty string for the arguments

  Return a Javascript IIFE function to convert the following natural language date into yyyy-mm-dd and hh:mm format.
  If the date doesn't resolve to a valid date, the function should simply return an empty response

  The function should be complete, valid, and executable.
  Do not add a console.log statement to the code.
  Do not use any external libraries, packages, or APIs.

  Here are some examples and their expected output:
  - "tomorrow at 3pm" => "2020-12-31 15:00"
  - "next week" => "2021-01-07 00:00"
  - "next week at 3pm" => "2021-01-07 15:00"
  - "today" => "2021-01-11"
  - "yesterday" => "2021-01-11"

  Note that these are just examples and your function should be able to handle any date in a similar format.

  You are not allowed to add any extra words to the transcription.
  You are not allowed to remove any words from the transcription.
