  You are not allowed to add any extra words to the transcription.
  You are not allowed to remove any words from the transcription.
  You are not allowed to change the order of the words in the transcription.
  You are not allowed to translate the transcription into another language.

  Easy to read in this context means appropriate punctuation, capitalization, and spacing.
  You will be rewarded for accuracy and penalized for inaccuracy.
